## Introduction
This is the official implementation & Dataset Introduction of our study on enhancing infant sleep safety through computer vision, presented in the context of the concerning uptick in U.S. infant mortality rates linked to unsafe sleep environments. Our research introduces CribNet, a novel framework leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for the detection and segmentation of toys and blankets in crib settings—a critical step forward in mitigating risks associated with infant sleep. The cornerstone of CribNet is the Crib Hazard Detection (CribHD) dataset, which is meticulously curated to include diverse subsets: CribHD-T for toys, CribHD-B for blankets, and CribHD-C for simulated hazard scenes within crib environments. This dataset, designed to fill the gap in data availability for crib safety research, will be made publicly accessible. By rigorously evaluating various advanced detection methods using CribNet, we validate the robustness of the CribHD dataset and underscore its potential for broad application.    </br>

### Example of an Annotation Entry

- **id**: Unique identifier for the annotation.
- **image_id**: Identifier for the image this annotation is associated with.
- **category_id**: Identifier for the category of the object being annotated.
- **bbox**: Bounding box for the object in the format `[x, y, width, height]`, where `(x, y)` represents the top-left corner of the box.
- **area**: Area of the bounding box.
- **segmentation**: A set of points defining the precise outline of the object, useful for segmentation tasks. For example, `[[x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn]]` represents a polygon around the object.
- **iscrowd**: Indicates if the annotation represents a single object (`0`) or a group of objects (`1`).


## Testing Blanket Occlusion Pipeline 

CribNet utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to identify and assess potential dangers presented by objects such as toys and blankets in crib environments. This pipeline aims to mitigate risks associated with infant sleep by providing a system capable of detecting occlusions and enhancing infant safety monitoring.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the CribNet script, you need to ensure your environment is set up correctly. The following are required:

- Python 3.9 or later
- OpenCV
- PyTorch and TorchVision (appropriate versions for your CUDA version if using GPU acceleration)
- Detectron2

You can install Detectron2 by running the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'

```

```bash
python code/occlusion-detection.py <image_path> <json_data_path> <output_image_path> <output_txt_path>
```
When executing the script, you will need to provide paths for the following:

- `image_path`: Path to the input image file.
  - Example: `/path/to/your/input_image.jpg`
- `json_data_path`: Path to the JSON file containing keypoints data.
  - Example: `/path/to/your/keypoints.json`
- `output_image_path`: Path where the output image will be saved.
  - Example: `/path/to/your/output_image.jpg`
- `output_txt_path`: Path where the output text file will be saved, indicating which keypoints are occluded.
  - Example: `/path/to/your/occlusions.txt`

Ensure to replace the example paths with the actual paths to your files.

#### Generating Keypoints for the Infant

To generate keypoints for the infant, you can utilize the Infant Pose Estimation repository available at [FIDIP](https://github.com/ostadabbas/Infant-Pose-Estimation). Follow the steps provided in the repository to set up the environment and generate keypoints data for your images.

#### Steps:

1. Visit the [Infant Pose Estimation GitHub repository](https://github.com/ostadabbas/Infant-Pose-Estimation).
2. Follow the installation instructions detailed in the repository to set up the necessary environment.
3. Utilize the provided scripts and models to generate keypoints data for your infant images.
4. Save the keypoints data in a JSON format compatible with our `occlusion-detection.py` script.

This process will provide you with the necessary keypoints data for your images, allowing you to visualize keypoints and detect occlusions using our CribNet script.

4. **Toy Detection and Keypoint Extraction**: 
    Execute the code blocks that implement toy detection and extract keypoints from the faces of infants in the dataset. This step utilizes pre-trained models and custom logic as detailed in the notebook.

5. **Filtering Toys Based on Criteria**: 
    Follow the notebook's guidance to filter the detected toys based on their distance from the infant's mouth and the size of the toys. This step is crucial for assessing potential risks posed by the toys.

6. **Model Evaluation and Filtering Results**: 
    After filtering, evaluate the effectiveness of the pipeline. The notebook provides instructions for assessing the results, including visualizations and metrics.

By completing this process, you will have implemented a Toy Filter Pipeline that detects toys, extracts relevant keypoints, and filters toys based on predefined criteria to ensure infant safety.
